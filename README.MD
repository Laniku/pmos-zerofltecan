**Samsung Galaxy S6 Patched Kernel for postmarketOS**

This repo contains my patches for the Galaxy S6, which, at the moment only has colour correction. I plan to fix sound later.

**Notice**
To apply my colour patch, add `CONFIG_FB_MSM_DEFAULT_DEPTH_ARGB8888=y` to the kernel config, or it won't build correctly.
